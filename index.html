Greetings, folks, and welcome to the new wissmiller.net. 
This is an experiment to see if I can move wissmiller.net to GitHub Pages. 
Currently wissmiller.net is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4B in my house. 
If I can get it to work "well enough" here, thinngs will be much easier 
because I won't have to maintain a full blown Apache web server 24x7.

I invite you to take a tour, and let me know what you think. 
To get on the email list for family news, such as genealogy and the annual Wissmiller reunion, please
send me an email. (See <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>.)
</p>
